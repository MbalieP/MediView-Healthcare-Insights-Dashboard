🏥 MediView Healthcare Insights Dashboard (Power BI)


📌 Project Overview

MediView Healthcare Insights Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to provide a comprehensive overview of hospital performance, patient demographics, treatment effectiveness, and cost behavior across 1,000 patients and 5 hospitals.

The dashboard helps hospitals understand:

Which treatments are most cost-efficient

How patient demographics influence recovery

What diagnoses are most common

How admission patterns change over time

How treatments differ across adults, children, and seniors

This end-to-end analytics solution supports informed decision-making and drives improvements in both clinical outcomes and operational efficiency.

❓ Business Question

How can hospitals reduce treatment costs while improving patient recovery outcomes across different demographics and diagnoses?

🔍 Key Insights
⭐ 1. Cost vs Outcome Gaps

High-cost treatments (e.g., surgery) do not always yield the strongest recovery outcomes.
→ Hospitals can reduce expenses by increasing use of mid-cost, high-recovery treatments.

⭐ 2. Diagnosis Trends

Conditions like hypertension, asthma, obesity, flu, and COVID-19 show different recovery patterns across age groups.
→ Allows targeted intervention based on diagnosis severity.

⭐ 3. Age-Based Differences

Seniors have the largest variability in both costs and recovery outcomes.

Children show generally stable recovery outcomes.

→ Highlights the need for age-tailored treatment approaches.

⭐ 4. Admission Seasonality

Admissions fluctuate heavily across months, affecting hospital staffing and resource planning.
→ Hospitals can optimize workforce and bed capacity during peak months.
