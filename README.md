# MediView Healthcare Insights Dashboard 

## Project Overview

MediView Healthcare Insights Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to provide a comprehensive overview of hospital performance, patient demographics, treatment effectiveness, and cost behavior across 1,000 patients and 5 hospitals.

The dashboard helps hospitals understand:

- Which treatments are most cost-efficient  
- How patient demographics influence recovery  
- What diagnoses are most common  
- How admission patterns change over time  
- How treatments differ across adults, children, and seniors  

This end-to-end analytics solution supports informed decision-making and drives improvements in both clinical outcomes and operational efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Insights

###  1. Cost vs Outcome Gaps  
High-cost treatments (e.g., surgery) do not always yield the strongest recovery outcomes.  
→ Hospitals can reduce expenses by increasing use of mid-cost, high-recovery treatments.

###  2. Diagnosis Trends  
Conditions like hypertension, asthma, obesity, flu, and COVID-19 show different recovery patterns across age groups.  
→ Enables targeted interventions.

###  3. Age-Based Differences  
- Seniors show the widest variability in cost and recovery  
- Children show generally stable outcomes  
→ Supports age-tailored treatment approaches.

###  4. Admission Seasonality  
Admissions fluctuate by month, impacting staffing and resources.  
→ Hospitals can optimize workforce and bed availability.
